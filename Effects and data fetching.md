## what is the Life cycle of a component 

1. **Initial Rendering (Mounting Phase)**  
   - This is the first phase when the component loads for the first time.  
   - The component renders initially when the website is opened.  
   - During this phase, it takes in the initial **props**.  

2. **Re-rendering (Updating Phase)**  
   - This happens when there is a change in the component's **state** or **props**.  
   - If the **parent component** changes, this component re-renders.  
   - It updates the UI based on new data.  

3. **Unmounting Phase**  
   - This is the final stage where the component is removed from the screen.  
   - Happens when the component is no longer needed (e.g., when moving to a different page).  
   - Any cleanup or final code runs before the component disappears.
